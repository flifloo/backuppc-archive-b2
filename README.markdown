BackupPC archive host B2
=======================
> Fork from [rtucker/backuppc-archive-s3](https://github.com/rtucker/backuppc-archive-s3)

This is a Python script that acts as an interface between
[BackupPC](http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/) and
[Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html).  It uses BackupPC's
[archive function](http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/faq/BackupPC.html#archive_functions)
to extract a tarball and split it into chunks, like the normal archive
function.  Then, the chunks are encrypted using gpg and transmitted to
B2 using [B2 Python SDK](https://github.com/Backblaze/b2-sdk-python).

Installation
------------

### Install the prerequisites

> You will need Python3.9, pip requirements, and a
> working BackupPC installation.

### Download and install this script

> Something like this seems like a good idea:
>  
>       cd /usr/local/src/
>       git clone git://github.com/rtucker/backuppc-archive-s3.git
>
> Then create a link from `/usr/share/backuppc/bin/` to here:
>
>       ln -s /usr/local/src/backuppc-archive-s3/BackupPC_archiveHost_s3 /usr/share/backuppc/bin/

### Configure this script

> Create a file in this directory called `secrets.py`, based upon the
> `secrets.py.orig` file.  It should have your AWS Access and Shared keys,
> a passphrase that will be used to encrypt the tarballs.
> 
>       accesskey = 'ASDIASDVINASDVASsvblahblah'
>       sharedkey = '889rv98rv8fmasmvasdvsdvasdv'
>       gpgsymmetrickey = 'hunter2'
>
> Previously, you could use a `speedfile` to change the permitted upstream
> bandwidth on the fly.  This was cantankerous and was ultimately dropped
> in September 2011.  See tag stable-20110610 if you need this functionality
> (and open an issue to let me know!), or take a look at
> [The Wonder Shaper](http://lartc.org/wondershaper/) to limit throughput
> on a system-wide level.
 
### Configure BackupPC

> From the BackupPC configuration interface, go to `Edit Hosts` and add a
> new host, `archiveS3`, which looks like the existing `archive` host.
> Save this, select the `archives3` host, and then `Edit Config` for that
> host.
> 
> Change the settings on each tab as follows:
> 
>> #### Xfer
>>      XferMethod:         archive
>>      ArchiveDest:        /var/lib/backuppc/archives3
>>      ArchiveComp:        bzip2
>>      ArchiveSplit:       500
>>      ArchiveClientCmd:   $Installdir/bin/BackupPC_archiveHost_s3 $tarCreatePath $splitpath $parpath $host $backupnumber $compression $compext $splitsize $archiveloc $parfile *
>> 
>> #### Backup Settings
>>      ClientTimeout:      720000
> 
> That should be just about it.  Note that `ArchiveDest` is where it will
> stage the tarballs before it uploads them; this must have enough disk
> space for your archive!  `ArchiveSplit` is the size of each tar file,
> in megabytes; you may want to adjust this for your needs.  Also, the
> `ArchiveClientCmd` is the default, except with the `_s3` added.

### Use it

> Go to the main page for the `archives3` host and click `Start Archive`.
> To start with, just tick the box next to the smallest backup you have,
> then `Archive selected hosts`.  Go with the defaults (which look
> suspiciously like what you set on the Xfer tab, do they not?  :-) and
> then `Start the Archive`.
> 
> Watch syslog and hopefully everything will work.  If it does not, there
> will be decent debugging output in the archive job's log, viewable via
> the BackupPC console.

backup-manager.py
-----------------

There is a companion script, `backup-manager.py`, that can be used to see
what's on S3.  Run it with no arguments to get a listing of backups and
their ages, or use the `--help` argument to see what it can do.

The "crown jewel" of this whole system is the `script` command, which
produces a script that can be used to restore a backup.  It uses S3's
[Query String Request Authentication](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?RESTAuthentication.html#RESTAuthenticationQueryStringAuth)
mechanism to generate temporary URLs to download each file required to
restore a backup.

Each night, from `cron`, I run a script:

        #!/bin/sh
        BACKUPMGR=/path/to/backup-manager.py

        # Delete all backups older than 30 days.
        $BACKUPMGR delete --age=30

        # Create restore scripts, valid for one week, for all of my computers
        cd /home/rtucker/Dropbox/RestoreScripts/
        $BACKUPMGR --expire=604800 --host=gandalf script > restore_gandalf.sh
        $BACKUPMGR --expire=604800 --host=witte script > restore_witte.sh
        # etc, etc

        # Output a list of what's on the server
        $BACKUPMGR

The output of this is mailed to me, so I always know what's going on!

FAQs
----
*   BackupPC is written in Perl.  Why is this thing written in Python?

    I know Python much better than I know Perl, so I wrote it in Python.
    The good news is that BackupPC doesn't care, but it does mean this
    probably won't be part of the BackupPC main distribution any time soon.

*   Is this project dead?

    You could say that.  A lot of [my projects](https://github.com/rtucker/)
    are one-off scripts that solve a very specific need I have, and I don't
    put too much thought into making them useful for other people.  This
    script works for me and (sorta) meets my needs, so that's where it is.

*   What changed in September 2011?

    I got tired of seeing a square-wave pattern on my throughput graphs,
    and so I modified the system to use Python's
    [multiprocessing](http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html)
    library.  It will now run GPG encryption jobs in the background,
    with as many CPUs as you have available, while transmitting files.

    This probably isn't a problem for anyone else, but my BackupPC server
    is slow (exactly one "Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 1.70GHz") and is
    behind a very asymmetric cable modem connection.
